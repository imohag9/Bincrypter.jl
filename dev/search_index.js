The bincrypter.sh tool modifies this file in place.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\npassword::Union{AbstractString, Nothing}=nothing: The password for encryption. If nothing, the input will be obfuscated without password protection.\nquiet::Bool=false: If true, suppresses all console output from the bincrypter script (corresponds to the -q flag).\nlock::Bool=false: If true, locks the resulting binary to the current system and user ID (corresponds to the -l flag).\nenv::Union{Dict{String, String}, Nothing}=nothing: A dictionary of environment variables to set for the bincrypter.sh process.                                                     For example, Dict(\"BC_PADDING\" => \"0\") to disable padding.\n\nSecurity Notes\n\nPassword Visibility: When password is provided, it is passed as a command-line argument to the underlying bincrypter.sh script. This means the password might be visible in process lists (e.g., ps aux) on the system for a short period. Exercise caution with sensitive information.\n\nExamples\n\n# Encrypt a file with a password\nbincrypter(\"my_script.sh\"; password=\"secret\")\n\n# Obfuscate a script\nbincrypter(\"my_script.sh\")\n\n# Lock a script to the current system\nbincrypter(\"my_important_script.sh\"; lock=true)\n\n# Obfuscate with a custom environment variable (e.g., disable padding)\nbincrypter(\"my_script.sh\"; env=Dict(\"BC_PADDING\" => \"0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#Bincrypter.download_script-Tuple{}","page":"API Reference","title":"Bincrypter.download_script","text":"The download_script function is called automatically when the module is loaded.
